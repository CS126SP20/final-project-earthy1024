This project is a simple drawing interface that uses the cinder library for application tools.

The drawing can than be saved into a file of your choosing on your device.
Along with the ui functionality is functionality to upload an image to an online image hosting site.
The link to the site can then be sent to another web api to craete a qr and the image will be retrieved and stored on a local file.
The file can then be uploaded to the application and the code will allow the user to open the image online.
